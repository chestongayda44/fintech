description: "Stage 1 (DS): find and pull the FRED series for the stress test"
---
Risk leadership wants to know how a 2-point rise in US unemployment would hit credit card
losses. In the open notebook notebooks/macro_credit_risk.ipynb, search FRED's own catalog
(series/search API, key in the FRED_API_KEY env var) for credit card delinquency and charge-off
rates, the unemployment rate, the fed funds rate and CPI. Pick the best series for each and
justify the choice by frequency, seasonal adjustment and coverage. Then add a markdown cell
documenting the picks and a code cell that pulls them, falling back to data/seed/ if the API
fails. Run it and summarise what we got.
